# Beer Management API

A .Net Web API application that manages Beer data. 
The main operations of the API are:
1. Creating beer collection. The main attributes of the beer are name, type (i.e., Pale ale, Stout), and optional rating (1-5).
2. Listing of all entries and ability to search by any matching letters in the name
3. Update beer rating by averaging the rating of all beers
